# Tryit backend developer test

This project is using express, GraphQL and ApolloServer to access a database containing informations about music tracks.

## Setup

To setup the application, clone the repository on your own computer. Open the project folder in your terminal and run ```npm install```. When you finished installing the packages, run ```npm run start```, to start the application. The server will run on port 3001. You can now make your own queries on ```http://localhost:3001/graphql```. This website will redirect you to Apollo's own sandbox tool where you can build your own queries easily.

If you want to run the tests, run the script ```test```.
